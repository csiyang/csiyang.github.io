            <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
            <p>
                What is neuroplasticity? You can split the word into two parts, “neuro”, meaning nerves or nervous system (referring to the brain), and “plasticity”, referring to the plastic nature of a substance, that is that the substance is changeable and malleable.
                Together it means that our brains can change both in a physical way as well as a meta-physical way. This way of thinking directly challenges what scientists have thought in the past, that our brains were fixed from birth!
            </p>
            <p>
                One of its core principles is that think about doing something and physically doing it uses the same mental pathways in your brain! What this means is that while practicing something physically is still preferred, the act of thinking about doing that
                same practice can have the same (albeit slightly reduced) effect on you physically.
            </p>
            <p>
                Benefits of understand neuroplasticity can help you much more efficiently develop a skill by imagining practicing it in conjunction with physical practice. This can benefit me when I feel stuck on a problem, that a really good way to solve it can be to
                step away from it and just to imagine solving it. It would be a good way to rest from the screen as well as change of pace without losing out on productivity.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many suggested ways in increasing your neuroplasticity from playing games, to learning a new language to making art. But what they all have in common is letting yourself try something new, practice having a good attitude towards it as you practice,
                and then to acknowledge and celebrate successes, big or small. Check <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/rewiring-your-brain#takeaway">here</a> here for some more examples.

            <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
            <p>
                A growth mindset is the idea that we are not limited to how we are now and that we can learn and grow more, where it be in stronger, smarter, or kinder etc. It is especially relevant because what someone believes about themselves will affect how they
                are. If someone wants to learn and grow, the first step is to believe they can learn and grown.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something that surprised me while researching this topic was that even just the knowledge of this can have an impressive impact on learning. It challenged my thinking when I saw how I viewed my potential, effect my actual potential. I often a very realistic
                person, when growth seems hard, I can view it as unrealistic. To integrate the growth mindset in my journey I want to be less defined by my current works and to believe more that I can be better than I am now and see that as possible.

            <h2>Learning Strategy+</h2>
            <p>
                Understanding these things can help me add to my learning plan. I view a lot of the things that I am doing as tasks that need to be completed, while helpful at times, when tasks aren’t completed, I can be negative about my work and my progress. Knowing
                these things helps me to allow myself to step back from the work and to think about it in a different way and not view that as being unproductive. It also helps me to adopt a “not yet” attitude towards work that I’m finding hard, to have
                a more positive attitude and to increase my learning in the long run in a health way!
