            <h1 id="title">Blog Post 3: EQ vs IQ</h1>
            <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence</h2>
            <p>
                EQ is the understanding and acknowledgment of your own mind. It directly relates to your emotions, and your understanding, management and use of them. A higher EQ means that you can understand and define the emotions you are feeling, and to know and execute
                what you need to do to solve that problem (if it needs to be solved!).
            </p>
            <p>
                EQ can be described as a collection of skills, and everyone can learn and grow in and it is useful in various parts of life.
            </p>
            <h2>How is it different to IQ</h2>
            <p>
                IQ is the measure of someone’s ability to solve logical problems, how efficiently they solve them and the understanding of abstract ideas. Often, it is measured by testing one’s reasoning, long-term, and short-term memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                The difference between EQ and IQ can be described using an analogy of a journey, a hike perhaps. Let’s call IQ Ian, and EQ Emma.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                During the hike, Ian is much more concerned about where they are going and how they are going to get there. How long is it going to take, is there enough food/water, how the track is, does the plan need to be updated.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                While Emma cares much more about how everyone is feeling, are there anyone that is exhausted, how is everyone connecting with each other, does anyone need anything. How am I feeling about this hike, am I enjoying myself or is there something keeping me
                from that?
            </p>
            <p>
                While not a perfect analogy, I hope it highlights how IQ strengths lie in solving problems that come up, where EQ helps one work well with themselves and others around them. I also hope it demonstrates how these skills work together in a person and the
                benefit that it brings.
            </p>
            <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
            <p>
                In the world that we live in, we do not live alone with ourselves, we are social beings that thrive of relations with others, being able to feel heard and understood and understanding others. This is idea is all-encompassing in our lives, not just with
                family/friends but also at the workplace.
            </p>
            <p>
                So being in a workplace is not just about efficiently you can complete tasks given to you, but also your journey to getting that work done. How did you feel throughout that time, how did you make your teammates feel, how well did you communicate and understand
                in a team context? These are all extremely important aspects to thrive and enjoy your workplace!
            </p>
            <h2>To summarize...</h2>
            <p>
                EQ helps you to understand yourself and to help you work better with yourself as well as others! While everyone can have different levels of EQ, we can all learn to grow in our ability to understand others and ourselves. But as with all things, there
                must be balance, true healthy happy living is more than just having a high EQ!
            </p>
