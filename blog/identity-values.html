        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            Hey you, yeah you! Welcome to my first blog! My name is Siyang and I welcome you to keep following me along my journey here at Dev Academy. At Dev Academy, you don't just learn about how to code, and this blog is the first part of the human skills learning aspect here. In this blog post you get to know me a little bit and read about my values and strengths!
        </p>

        <h2>Core Values</h2>
        <p>
            Prehaps the most important thing to know about me is that I am a Christian. I won't delve too much into it here, but quote to sum it up is "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind" Matthew 22:37
        </p>
        <p>
            I love technollogy and discussing exciting up and coming advances, music is an important part of my life and I enjoy listening to most genres, but especailly enjoy playing the piano. In my spare time I like to game, my current favourite game is Monster Hunter!
        </p>
        <p>
            One of my core values is individual achievement, that is to say I try not to compare my work to others. I truly feel accomplished when achieve goals that I set for myself. (As long as I don't set my standards too high!). I have a high standard of integreity for myself. If I say im going to do something, it is really important me that I do it. It is something that I believe is the right thing to do, and don't really view it as anything too special. Often understanding is of the greatest importance for myself or if im teaching something to someone when there is sufficient time to meet deadlines.

            I was recently planning my move to Auckland and was looking for places to live. Places were limited, but I was thankful to find a flat. About a week later the head tenant tells me that the flat is disbanding. Disheartened, I started looking for other options. I found a new place relatively easily, but as I was confirming details, the original place got back to me to say that they’re no longer disbanding. o	As I was weighing up my options, the new place was seemingly better in almost every way, but in the end, I decided to go with the original place. The main reason being, I had already agreed to go there, and my word was more important to me than the benefits. I lose the chance to live with a previous flatmate, get a better price for the room, and easier transport options.

            My friends see me as warm person in working situations. In the past I was in charge of the set up and running of the lighting for a conference. I worked closely with the audio visual team, and we solved a lot of problems together and it was job to do it with them. Another friend viewed as someone who loves a challenge. That challenges are not obstacles but as a way to grow personally.

            I was born in China and moved to New Zealand at the age of 6. My cultural identity is a mix of traditional Asian as well as Kiwi. As a Kiwi Asian, it can be hard at times to find where I fit into society between the tradition that is expected of me vs the person that I have grown up as. But it also helps me to connect with a wider range of people and to form genunine cross cultural friendships!

            My Myers Briggs personality test classes me as a ISTJ (Introverted, Observant, Thinking, Judging) and standout traits described that I think are accurate are: practical, logical, dutiful, strong willed, responsible, honest, direct, integrity, loyal, fact based, stubborn, by the book, judgmental, insensitive.

        <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
        <p>
        I work best when I know what my responsibilites are, have clear definitions for them and be able to work on it in my own time, given a time frame. Im a very analyitical person, many of my interactions is to 'fix a problem', im well aware that I can often come off as uncaring or cold so I often put great care in how I speak. If I give my word that I will do something, I will do everything in power to do it, even if it may be unresaonable for me to do so. For the most part im a realistic person when it comes to problems but can have too high of a standard for myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            In learning I love understanding what I am doing and how it fits into the wider context. This has served me well for other studies that I have completed, but when there is no clear guidlines I can get stressed out very easily. I have no problem with working hard when I know I don't understand something, but I find this harder when I feel like I understand, but don't.
        </p>
        <p>
            In working with others I like to bring harmony in team enviroments, conflict both makes work inefficent and makes me uncomfortable, and I prefer to resolve them quickly, or just ignore them if I am unable to solve them. Because of this I often will not voice my opions if I feel like will lead to conflict but not add that much value.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Ending thoughts...</h2>
        <p>
            And there it is, the enod of my first ever blog post. I hope you found it insightful reading about my values and strengths. Honestly blog posting is wee bit out of my comfort zone, but I am excited to see where this will take me!
