            <h1 id="title">Blog Post 5: Reflection</h1>
            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>
                And that’s it, the end of foundations! With the end of this week (plus a 1-week break) the bootcamp intensive begins! To round of this section of my time here at EDA this blog post is going to reflect over what I’ve learnt about myself in the last 5 weeks.
            </p>
            <h2>Core Learnings</h2>
            <p>
                From the non-technical blog posts (which I will now refer to as ‘core’) a large range of topics were covered. For myself I was quite familiar with a lot of the topics already, but there were a few things that I found helpful to be reinforced on. One was
                thinking about my learning plan, and not just for the next few months but looking ahead to the next few years and keeping that perspective as I continue through foundations and bootcamp. Another point that really helped to keep remembering
                was the idea of a growth mindset and self-talk. Knowing that we can all improve no matter what spot we’re in and it starts from my own mind and what I tell myself, was a quite a freeing experience and I hope will continue to allow me to
                grow in a healthy way.
            </p>
            <h2>Empathy and Self-Awareness</h2>
            <p>
                Programming is team exercise (although it can often seem like it isn’t) and a big part to succeeding as team is communication. To be a good communicator we must understand ourselves and our values as well as an awareness to how others think and feel.
                We may have certain things that are in common, but we are all different, in our world views, our up bringing and our current values. Even if I’m amazing at the technical aspect of programming, if I fail to communicate/ listen well to my
                team, my overall effectiveness and contribution still comes out less.
            </p>
            <h2>Surpise!</h2>
            <p>
                The thing the surprised me the most about the core content was just how much of a focus was placed on it. I initially thought the split might be 80% technical and 20% core but the difference was much closer to 50/50. At first, I wanted to get through
                the core content as fast as possible, but as I realized, I allowed myself to slow down and take my time on the core content.
            </p>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                The most challenging things about the core content was writing about myself. I’m an introspective person and think internally think about a lot of things, and I find it ok to write technical reports. But when it comes to writing about the things I’m thinking
                about, it suddenly feels x1000 harder.
            </p>
            <h2>EDA and CORE</h2>
            <p>
                While it was surprising that EDA spent so much time on core, I do believe that it was all time well spent. The main reason being very similar to what I wrote in the empath and self-awareness section. Communication and working together is so important,
                it was reassuring to see EDA back up that claim by giving the appropriate time to the core material. While it is even now still tempting to wish I had used the time to be coding instead, I believe that a lot of the benefits from core will
                only be seen later during bootcamp and working with my cohort!
            </p>

            <p>
                And that’s it for now. Not really too sure if we continue to blog during bootcamp, see you then if it does :)
