            <h1 id="title">Blog Post 2: Learning Plan</h1>
            <h2>Bootcamp</h2>
            <p>
                This post is to add to this learning plan post now that I’ve finished the foundation part as well as looking forward to the bootcamp and my updated learning plan for it.
            </p>
            <p>
                My long-term goal still hasn’t really changed and for the foreseeable future after my time at EDA is still to work for not-for-profit Christian organization. I’m not too sure of where I want to work when I first graduate, but it is where I want to end
                up eventually.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thinking back on my strengths, I think my wanting to understand has led me to a good foundation of back-end logic, most of what I find hard technically is finding the right syntax. As for limitations, I would say it’s my time management. It isn’t a problem
                when I manage it well, but almost all my stress behavior comes out when it’s not managed well, and I feel like I’m running out of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                A non-technical skill that I can struggle with and want to develop in my time here at EDA, is voicing my ideas. I can find it hard to voice my idea if I feel like there’s even a slight chance it might cause some discourse. On the other side I can also
                come across too strong and over state my idea. I would love to learn how to balance this throughout bootcamp.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I look forward to starting bootcamp, I’m honestly not too sure what to expect of the content and the facilitators. I know a little about some of the things we’ll be doing, such as some group work, and some lectures from the facilitators, I really don’t
                know what to expect to happen in a day at bootcamp. As for myself, not much has changed, since it is required to come in, it’ll make it easier to motivate myself to wake up on time in the morning. My other commitments really haven’t changed,
                but it may be new to learn to fit that around bootcamp.
            </p>

            <h2>Foundations</h2>
            <p>
                I am studying at Dev Academy because I have a long-term goal to becoming a senior web developer and using those skills to work not for profit Christian organizations in need to adapting in this digital age.
            </p>
            <p>
                I see my facilitator as someone who wants to help me learn to the best of my ability. They are someone who does not mind me asking them for help but do have a lot of other people they are helping also.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of my strengths include really desiring to understanding how things work rather than just being able to use them. I hold myself to a high level of integrity, which helps when I am working with others, but can work against me as I tend to set too
                high a standard for myself. Another limitation is that I can get easily stressed out when I do not understand or feel like I do not have enough time.
            </p>
            <p>
                During EDA I am committed to seek help in a timely manner, I can struggle with finding the balance between giving the work a good go vs asking for help, so I will be asking the facilitator for feedback as I ask for help.
            </p>
            <p>
                To manage my workload, I will do all in power to work during normal working hours (9-5), more time can be spent on this, but I do also want to be mindful on keeping a good work/life balance. My plan is to try being in the Auckland office for work as much
                as it is possible for me so that I can work in community and to be mutually accountable for putting in the hours. Other things I need to manage my time around are my Church commitments, which are a group meeting Wednesday evening, and
                Sunday service in the morning. My Open Polytechnic papers which has a flexible time that I can work in around Dev Academy.
