            <p>
                I am studying at Dev Academy because I have a long-term goal to becoming a senior web developer and using those skills to work not for profit Christian organizations in need to adapting in this digital age.
            </p>
            <p>
                I see my facilitator as someone who wants to help me learn to the best of my ability. They are someone who does not mind me asking them for help but do have a lot of other people they are helping also.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of my strengths include really desiring to understanding how things work rather than just being able to use them. I hold myself to a high level of integrity, which helps when I am working with others, but can work against me as I tend to set too
                high a standard for myself. Another limitation is that I can get easily stressed out when I do not understand or feel like I do not have enough time.
            </p>
            <p>
                During EDA I am committed to seek help in a timely manner, I can struggle with finding the balance between giving the work a good go vs asking for help, so I will be asking the facilitator for feedback as I ask for help.
            </p>
            <p>
                To manage my workload, I will do all in power to work during normal working hours (9-5), more time can be spent on this, but I do also want to be mindful on keeping a good work/life balance. My plan is to try being in the Auckland office for work as much
                as it is possible for me so that I can work in community and to be mutually accountable for putting in the hours. Other things I need to manage my time around are my Church commitments, which are a group meeting Wednesday evening, and
                Sunday service in the morning. My Open Polytechnic papers which has a flexible time that I can work in around Dev Academy.
