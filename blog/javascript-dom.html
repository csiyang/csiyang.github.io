            <h1 id="title">Technical Blog: Javascript Fundamentals</h1>
            <h2>Javascript and the DOM</h2>

            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a key component in web development, while HTML contains the content and CSS the style of the web page, JavaScript contains the interactions the user can have with the webpage.
            </p>

            <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
            <p>
                To explain HTML and CSS a little more how about a quick story?
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                Henry loved to work; he had no trouble producing thousands of lines of code in space of seconds. But Henry was very bad at organization and presentation. His wife Cassandra, however, was very good at it. In just a few simple lines Cassandra would leave
                Henry's working looking organized and professional. Sometimes Cassandra gets confused and NOTHING lines up, but eventually with the help of many others, Cassandra will be back up to speed in no time!
            </p>
            <p>
                As you might have guessed Henry represents HTML, it is simple to use and as far as a basic web page, its all you need! If, however, you would like to add some styling and make all that content look nice, we look to CSS (Cassandra). But while seeming simple
                at first, due to the nature how positioning, CSS can become complicated.
            </p>

            <h3>Control Flows and Loops</h3>
            <p>
                A control flow lets you know the sequence to do things in. It can be like cooking recipe! You always prepare the ingredients fist, and then you can add in ingredients and heat following this recipe to finish the dish. Loops are like when you need to add
                something to the mixture, you are not sure how much, so you add a little, stir a little until you get your desired outcome.
            </p>
            <p>
                The control flow lets you know the order that the code is executed in so that the program can run in a predictable way. And the loop lets the program know to repeat something until a condition has been met.
            </p>

            <h3>Interacting with the DOM</h3>
            <p>
                The DOM stands for Document Object Model, and it uses JavaScript to display the contents of a web page, which includes both the HTML and the CSS code. It gets displayed in a tree format where a parent node can have child nodes that can also be parents
                to other child nodes. The developer can then manipulate the web page through the DOM by making changes in code (it’s a local version, so it won’t change it for other people) such as changing text, the color of certain elements and the
                layout. There are also other helpful tools to let you make permanent changes, see the efficiency of your page and much much more!
            </p>
            <p>
                Simply put, the DOM displays the code of the page for a developer to see and manipulate with JavaScript.
            </p>

            <h3>Arrays vs Objects</h3>
            <p>
                An array is a collecting of elements (such as sentences or numbers, or even objects) and to access those elements you make use of the index, which is the position of the element you want to access. If you do not know the position, there are also helpful
                search functions that can search through an array for the element that you are looking for.
            </p>
            <p>
                An object is exactly like it sounds, an object, and it can be anything! An object has characteristics or properties, that can be set. For example, a dog object can have the property of name which is Sam and a property of color which is brown. To access
                data in an object, you simply state the object you want to investigate followed by a dot and then the property that you want to find out.
            </p>

            <h3>Functions, and why they're needed</h3>
            <p>
                A function is a collection of instructions that is executed when called by the program. It can seem counter intuitive at first, you might say “why not just write all the code in the main program?”, and that is because a program can be thousands of lines
                long and a function lets you use that collection of code easily at other places in your code without having to retype it. Often, it can be hard to read another developer’s code, and functions help that as it splits up the tasks and makes
                the code easier to understand.
            </p>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                The things we talked about in this blog post, as the saying goes, is only the tip of the iceberg. There much more intricacies of the interactions between HTML CSS and JavaScript, manipulating the DOM and the flow, types, and functions of a program! I
                am still learning myself but is not it exciting to think of all the things you can do with it!
