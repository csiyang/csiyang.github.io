            <h2>Readability and Problem Solving</h2>

            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>
                In this sprint the two main things we covered were code readability and how to solve programming problems. I found this week quite fun to work through and I am excited to share with you what I learnt!
            </p>
            <h3>Code Readability</h3>
            <p>
                A lot of people can write code, but much less people write good code. Although the topic is quite subjective there are standards that programmers around the world like to hold to.
            </p>
            <p>
                One such standard is code indenting. This is the idea that the tags in the code should be on a different line than the content, the content should be indented either using spaces or tab (but must remain consistent throughout your code). Exceptions to
                this rule is the head and body tag, this is because they are always under the html tag. On top of this, inline elements (such as bold, underline, italic, highlight, etc...) should be written inline and not on its own line.
            </p>
            <p>
                The code you write should also be short. Short code is easier to understand, to test and means you do not have to repeat certain code segments. Also, in devlopment, it reduces the risk to have to change that code for the future, whether to update or to
                remove, as you will just add new functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some further principles are code should be focused, one function does one thing, and to add functionality, you simply add more functions. Make your code simple and extendable, keeping in mind the others who might to look at your code and work on it. Code
                should have minimal dependencies, to help control things that might break your code thats not under your care. Always have acceptance test and meaningful variable names so others can understand your code easier.
            </p>
            <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
            <p>
                When first looking into the problem solving, we were presented with a list of suggested ways to do so. Now I want to ask you, have you ever heard of the 'Rubber Ducky' method? Well I definitely did not. A bit of further reasearch revealed that it is the
                act of forcing yourself to go through the code line by line and explain it as if to someone with no programming experience. The idea is as you voice out the logic of your code, you can see the inconsistencies much easier. Oh and the rubber
                duck is just there so you don't have bother someone else!
            </p>
            <p>
                The list of suggested ways to solve problems was this:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pseudocode</li>
                <li>Just try something!</li>
                <li>Rubber ducky</li>
                <li>Reading the error messages</li>
                <li>Console logging</li>
                <li>Google is your best friend</li>
                <li>Asking peers for help</li>
                <li>Asking the coach for help</li>
                <li>Self relection</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Overall, with the bit of background I have in programming, I found myself natrually using all these ways without having to think much about it.
            </p>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                I really enjoyed the flow of figuring out problems this week. I found the most common way I solve problems was though google and console logging. It helped me to figure out what the function was meant to do (googling), and what my function was doing (console
                logging). A lot of these cases arose in dealing with javascript objects and their syntax. It did get a little fustrating at times, but it was good to learn to trust the process of learning and being ok with being fustrated. In the end
                all the problems were solved, maybe not in the most efficent way, but at least nothing had a T(n) = n^2 or greater! (Hit me up if you understood that!)
